**Usage in Proxmox**
-------------------

This template is designed to be used in Proxmox, a popular virtualization platform. To use this template in Proxmox, simply:

1. Download the template and upload it to your Proxmox server
2. Create a new LXC container using the template
3. Configure the container's settings as desired (e.g. CPU, RAM, network)
4. Start the container and access it via the Proxmox web interface or using the `pct` command-line tool

Once the container is running, you can access it via the console or using SSH. From there, you can use the various tools and software included in the template to develop and deploy your applications.

**Example Use Cases**
--------------------

* Develop a Python 3 project: `python3 myproject.py`
* Develop a Golang project: `go build myproject`
* Develop a Node.js project: `npm install express`
* Develop a C/C++ project: `gcc myproject.cpp`

**Troubleshooting**
------------------

If you encounter any issues, check the following:

* Make sure you have the latest version of Proxmox installed
* Check the Proxmox logs for any errors related to the container
* If you need help, check the Proxmox documentation: <https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page>
